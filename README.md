# memecheats
An old external cheat I created for CS:GO in highschool. It contains several bad coding practices and should not be something to look at other than how some of the logic works for grabbing information for whatever feature you want

## Requirements
- d3dx9 library files
- Windows SDK
- Visual Studio C++ Distributable files

## Features
- Auto bhop
- Wallhack (glow)
- Triggerbot
- Aimbot (This is what requires d3dx9

*It should be noted that the updated offsets are from 12/28/20 and CSGO is moving to Source 2. It is likely that most of these features no longer work (for example,the glow struct used here is different from what is live on CS:GO as they've updated it since then).*
