# MemeCheats

MemeCheats is an outdated external cheat that was developed for CS:GO during high school. Please be aware that the code contained in this repository includes numerous coding practices that are not recommended. It is strongly advised against using this code as a reference for professional programming practices. However, you may find some value in understanding the logic behind certain features and how information was gathered for specific functionalities.

## Requirements:

    d3dx9 library files
    Windows SDK
    Visual Studio C++ Distributable files

## Features:

    Auto Bhop
    Wallhack (glow)
    Triggerbot
    Aimbot (Requires d3dx9 library)

Please note that the codebase relies on offsets from December 28, 2020, and it was developed prior to the transition of CS:GO to Source 2. As a result, it is highly likely that most of these features are no longer functional. For instance, the glow struct used in this code differs from the current live version of CS:GO, as it has undergone updates since its initial development.
